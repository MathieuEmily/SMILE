Description: The aim of this package is to propose an implementation of the SMILE statistical method. Such a method aims at detecting subpopulation(s) (breed for example) under selection. Based on the haplotype data in a given genomic region, the method computes the d2s dissimilarity and performs a hierarchical clustering to extract the subpopulation under selection.
